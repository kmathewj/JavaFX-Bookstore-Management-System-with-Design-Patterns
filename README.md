# JavaFX-Bookstore-Management-System-with-Design-Patterns

A GUI-based bookstore management application developed using Java and JavaFX, designed with a strong emphasis on object-oriented principles and software design patterns. The system was modeled using UML use case and class diagrams to ensure clear separation of concerns and maintainable architecture.

The application supports role-based functionality, allowing administrators to manage customers and book inventory, while customers can browse available books and complete purchases through an intuitive graphical interface. Core behavioral and structural design patterns—including State, Singleton, Strategy, and Adapter—were integrated to manage application flow, user interactions, and system extensibility.

This project demonstrates proficiency in Java application development, GUI design, software architecture, and design pattern implementation.
